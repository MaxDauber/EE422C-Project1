# Simple Sorting tools in Java
Several implementations of very simple sorting tools are stored in the SortTools class, and the test cases 
to view if the tools are working are stored in the main method in Main.

To run, download and compile both Main and SortTools and then run Main
```python
java Main.java SortTools.java
javac Main
```
